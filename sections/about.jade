      h3 Why mathscon?
      p We are a group of a students who admire the beauty of Mathematics. Mathematics is about the concept, not the calculations. It is about shaping thought, not following rules. And we want everyone to know about this. Our mission is to reshape the world's perception of Mathematics.
      p As we all are subject enthusiasts, we are also sharing the experience of doing research, learning similar modules or stumbling upon hard questions in Mathematics. In an attempt to collaborate and find synergy from our knowledge around the World in a single place we invite you to London â€“ a place you will surely fit in!
