    h3 about us
    p We are a group of a students who admire the beauty of Mathematics. Mathematics is about the concept, not the calculations. It is about shaping thought, not following rules. And we want everyone to know about this.
    p 
      |That's why we created 
      b Mathscon
      |.
    p Our mission is to reshape the world's perception of Mathematics. We aim to do so by organizing a series of events, all around the world, starting in London, this February.
    p Mathscon is more than a usual conference. We we want to expose the public to different activities to make them realize how truly amazing Mathematics is. Renowned speakers will give inspirational lectures. Intellectual workshops will be organised in order to illustrate the applications of the mother of all sciences. And finally the conference will end with an engaging social event during which, one will have the chance to discuss anything with the organisers, speakers and other guests.
    p Feel free to contact us if you have any questions. We hope to see you in February!
